# Governance

## ID Naming Rules
- **User Story (US)**: `US-XXX` (e.g., US-001)
- **Transformation (T)**: `T-YYYYMMDD-###` (e.g., T-20231024-001)

## Policies
- All user stories must be linked to a Transformation ID upon implementation.
- Every Transformation must include a context preservation verification.
- Code changes must be reviewed structurally before merge.

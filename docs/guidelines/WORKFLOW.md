# Development Workflow

## 1. Context Loading
Start by understanding the PRD (`docs/specs/PRD.md`) and User Story Map (`docs/specs/user-stories/index.md`).

## 2. Transformation-Based Development
Follow the `CLAUDE.md` principles:
1. Identify a Transformation (structural change).
2. Record it in `docs/transformations/TRANSFORMATIONS.md`.
3. Plan design options (Architecture, etc.).
4. Implement code changes in small increments.
5. Verify changes (Tests, Lint).
6. Update documentation.

## 3. Pull Requests
- Keep PRs small and focused on a single Transformation.
- Include a summary of changes and structural impact.
